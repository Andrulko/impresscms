Working Changes : (Changes to be reverted or made definitive)

- Security Audit : making sure that header & redirect_header are followed with exit(); (protection from telnet vulnerability aswell as other instances where the page is viewed with a system that does not understand the 'header' function, it would skip the redirection page and continue displaying the rest of page. (Vaughan)
- Security Audit : making sure that sql query values are all encapsulated in single quotes, helps prevent SQLi. Added intval to values in sql queries that should only be an integer value. (Vaughan)
