   2. Ensure mainfile.php, cache, templates_c and uploads are writable by the webserver
   3. Access the folder where you installed the htdocs/ files using your web browser to launch the installation wizard

Files integrity check
==================================

The ImpressCMS package is released with a script able to check if all the system files were correctly uploaded to the server. To use it, follow these instructions:

   1. Upload the impresscms_md5.php and impresscms.md5 files located in the ImpressCMS package root to your ImpressCMS server folder (putting them next to mainfile.php).
   2. Execute impresscms_md5.php with your browser
   3. If necessary, re-upload the missing or corrupted system files

Revealing the blank page backtrace log
==================================

ImpressCMS displays a basic error page when a fatal error preventing it to run is encountered. To help you diagnose the cause of the error, this page contains additional messages that are hidden by default. To reveal them, use your browser "select all" function (for most browsers, you can use "Ctrl+A").


Modules, themes and languages
==================================

The packages do not contain any module apart from the system one. You are invited to browse the ImpressCMS Addons web site at http://addons.impresscms.org to get all the modules, themes and languages you need.

We also highly recommend the installation of the Protector module which will bring additional protection and logging capabilities to your site.
