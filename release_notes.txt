ImpressCMS 1.3.10
======================
This release fixes several security vulnerabilities, both in the ImpressCMS core and in external libraries (PHPMailer). It is highly recommended you update to this latest version 1.3.10 of ImpressCMS. 

Installation
------------
Unzip the contents of the 'htdocs' folder in the root folder of your site, and go in a browser to the address of your site. ImpressCMS will detect that no configuration is present, and will start the installation procedure to help you setup your site on your webserver.

Update
------
When updating from a previous version in the 1.3 series, overwrite your existing installation and update the system module once you are logged in, that will bring you to the latest version.
