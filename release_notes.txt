The XOOPS development team is pleased to announce the release of XOOPS 2.0.17.1.

This is merely a bugfix release. Some main changes include:

- Improvement on uploader mimetype check

Users who still suffer from login problem after implementing the patch are suggested to turn on custom session in system preferences, or set "enableRegenerateId" to FALSE in /kernel/session.php line #78.

Upgrading from any XOOPS ranging from 2.0.7 to 2.0.13.2 (using the full package):
   1. Move the "upgrade" folder inside the "htdocs" folder (it's been kept out as it's not needed for full installs)

  10. Update the "system" module from the modules administration interface


Files integrity check
-----------------------------------

The full XOOPS package is released with a script able to check if all the system files were correctly uploaded to the server. To use it, follow these instructions:

   1. Upload the xoops_md5.php and xoops.md5 files located in the XOOPS package root to your XOOPS server folder (putting them next to mainfile.php).
   2. Execute xoops_md5.php with your browser
   3. If necessary, re-upload the missing or corrupted system files
   4. Remove xoops_md5.php and xoops.md5 from your server


Revealing the blank page backtrace log
-----------------------------------

XOOPS displays a basic error page when a fatal error preventing it to run is encountered. To help you diagnose the cause of the error, this page contains additional messages that are hidden by default. To reveal them, use your browser "select all" function (for most browsers, you can use "Ctrl+A").


Incompatibility with some modules
---------------------------------

Beginning with XOOPS 2.0.14, a change in the core template methods resulted in some incompatibilities with some modules that do not have their templates under (dirname)/templates/ as many XOOPS modules do. Please read extras/readme.txt for workaround instructions.

Modules
-----------------------------------

The packages do not contain any module apart from the system one. You are invited to browse the XOOPS modules repository to get some. Note: as a new repository is being built, the current repository is not up-to-date, PLEASE VISIT DEVELOPERS' WEBSITES TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING PROPER VERSION OF MODULES.

We also highly recommend the installation of the Protector module which will bring additional protection and logging capabilities to your site.
