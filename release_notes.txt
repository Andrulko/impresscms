Revealing the blank page backtrace log
==================================

ImpressCMS displays a basic error page when a fatal error preventing it to run is encountered. To help you diagnose the cause of the error, this page contains additional messages that are hidden by default. To reveal them, use your browser "select all" function (for most browsers, you can use "Ctrl+A").


Modules, themes and languages
==================================

The packages do not contain any module apart from the system one. You are invited to browse the ImpressCMS Addons web site at http://addons.impresscms.org to get all the modules, themes and languages you need.

We also highly recommend the installation of the Protector module which will bring additional protection and logging capabilities to your site.
